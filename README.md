# snake_game
Welcome to the repository of my Python Snake Game! This is an implementation of the classic game of Snake using Python.

In this game, you control a dot (the snake) on the screen. The aim of the game is to eat as many pieces of food as possible, which causes the snake to grow longer. The game ends when the snake collides with itself or the boundary of the playing field.

Key Features:
Easy Gameplay: Simple, intuitive controls make the game easy to pick up and play.
Increasing Difficulty: As your score increases, so does the speed of the snake, making the game progressively more challenging.
Score Tracking: The game keeps track of your score, so you can aim to beat your high score every time you play.
Technologies Used:
This game is built entirely in Python, and utilizes the following libraries:

Pygame: A set of Python modules designed for writing video games. Pygame adds functionality on top of the excellent SDL library.
Sys & Random: Standard Python libraries used to control various functionalities of the Python runtime environment.
How to Play:
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Install the necessary Python packages. Instructions are provided in the requirements.txt file.
